	<h3>Unfortunately, there wasn't a settlement available for any of the breaches in which you were compromised.
	This is a simulation of the process you would have gone through if there had been a settlement available.</h3>
	<p>Using the information you input on the previous page, we have generated a "Settlement Claim Form" for you.
	A Settlement Claim Form is the document you would have sent to the company managing the distribution of the settlement
	money. A few weeks later, they would have sent you your settlement check.</p>
