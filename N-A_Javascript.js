//(3) receive data from a server after the page has loaded, (4) send data to a server in the background. These combine to allow a user to get quicker results when they search,
//and without having to see the page completely refresh. See http://www.w3schools.com/xml/dom_httprequest.asp.

      writeData(xhttp.responseText);
